# Vendora

## Overview

Vendora is a peer-to-peer, over-the-counter trade facilitator for digital assets including ETH, ERC721s (NFTs), ERC1155s, and ERC20 tokens. The contract ensures trades are properly validated, terms are finalized, and assets are correctly deposited before completing any trade. The contract also offers the option to cancel a trade provided certain conditions are met.

## Features

- Create and finalize trade terms.
- Secure deposit of assets (ETH, ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC20) ensuring all trade conditions are satisfied before execution.
- Cancel trades under certain conditions, ensuring the rightful return of assets.
- Atomically complete trades, transferring all assets to their rightful owners.
- Generate unique trade IDs.
- Helper functions to validate, deposit, and transfer assets.

## Main Functions

### 1. `createAndFinalizeTrade`
Allows users to create a new trade by setting the terms which include the assets to be exchanged. The function ensures the trade is unique and finalizes the terms.

### 2. `cancelAndDeleteTrade`
Allows either the buyer or seller to cancel a trade if specific conditions are met. If one party has already met their terms but the other hasn't, the assets of the party that met the terms are returned.

### 3. `completeTrade`
Executes the trade, transferring assets to the respective parties. This function is internal and is called once all conditions for a trade are satisfied.

### 4. `generateTradeId`
Generates a unique trade ID based on the seller, buyer, and timestamp.
